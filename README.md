## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Accessing the endpoints
I hooked up swagger open API to the project so as to make it easy to access and test
Just open your browser once the app is running, and access 
http://localhost:3000/api
