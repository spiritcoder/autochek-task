## Installation
cd into the App root directory on your terminal and run the code below
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app
Still inside the root directory of the APP on your terminal, run any of these codes depending on the action you wish to take
```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Accessing the endpoints
I hooked up swagger open API to the project so as to make it easy to access and test
Just open your browser once the app is running, and access 
http://localhost:3000/api
